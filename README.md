# Welcome to learn-golang :yellow_heart:

This repository is where I document my journey of learning Go (Golang) â€” from the basics to building real projects!

Iâ€™ll be sharing notes, code snippets, and examples along the way so that others starting out can also learn with me. ðŸš€

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The project is organized into folders by **lessons**, so each topic stays separate and easy to follow :

| Lesson    | Topic              | Description                                    |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| lesson-00 | Hello World        | Writing your first Go program                  |
| lesson-01 | Intro to Packages        | Different types of packages and how they are used.                  |
| lesson-02 | Types  | Primitive and Composite Data Types |
| lesson-03 | Variables          | Declaring variables and constants                 |
| lesson-04 | Conditionals | `if-else` and `switch` statements           |
| lesson-05 | Loops | `if`, `for`, and `switch` statements |

ðŸ‘‰ Each lesson folder contains :
- A `.go` file â†’ runnable code for that lesson
- Notes to explain the concept
