# Welcome to learn-golang :yellow_heart:

This repository is where I document my journey of learning Go (Golang) — from basics to building real projects!

I’ll be sharing notes, examples,  practice questions and small projects along the way so that others starting out can also learn with me! 🚀

## 📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized into folders by **lessons**, so each topic stays separate and easy to follow :

| Lesson    | Topic              | Description                                    |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| lesson-00 | Hello World        | Writing your first Go program                  |
| lesson-01 | Intro to Packages        | Different types of packages and how they are used.                  |
| lesson-02 | Types  | Primitive and Composite Data Types |
| lesson-03 | Variables          | Declaring variables and constants                 |
| lesson-04 | Conditionals | `if-else` and `switch` statements           |
| lesson-05 | Loops | `if`, `for`, and `switch` statements |

👉 Each lesson folder contains :
- A `.go` file → runnable code for that lesson
- Notes to explain the concept
